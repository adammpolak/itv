Hey

<br>

This is Adam Polak's website.

<br>

It's pretty lame right now.

<br>

Currently this is my priority project to understand devops a bit better.

<br>

Soon I will keep track of my projects and interests and stuff here.

<br>

but right now its a way for me to test deployment without the easy tools (no heroku)
